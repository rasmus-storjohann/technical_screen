## Technical screen project

Implemented using React in javascript.

Shows a list of community centres, filtered by a user supplied string. That's as far as I got.

## Folder structure

### businessInterfaces

Contains data structures that are used to communicate among different business logic pieces and components. In a language that uses interfaces and dependency injection, the interfaces would also belong here, hence the name.

### businessObjects

Contains files that implement business logic.

### components

Contaions visible components implemented using React.

## Short comings

Couldn't figure out how to load the data from an FTP end point, found two different broken npm packages.
